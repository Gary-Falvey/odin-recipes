    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A Scotch egg is a soft-boiled egg that has been wrapped in pork sausage, breaded,
    and deep-fried or baked. Despite its name, this likely has English (not Scottish) origins.
    Scotch eggs are commonly served cold at picnics in the U.K. and packaged Scotch eggs are
    widely available in British supermarkets, corner shops, and gas stations.</p>
